<p>Our history
definitely makes us stand out.&#xA0;</p>
<p>We grew out of Fort Ord, a decommisioned Army base with a rich
history going&#xA0;back to 1917.&#xA0; Throughout the &apos;50s, &apos;60s
and &apos;70s, Fort Ord was a major location for basic training,
reaching its heyday during the Vietnam War.&#xA0; Even celebs like
Jerry Garcia and Clint Eastwood completed boot camp here. In all,
more that 1.5 million men and women received basic training at Fort
Ord.</p>
<p>When Congress decided to shut down Fort Ord, the local community
proposed&#xA0;the base be converted into a university. In June
1994, that plan was approved and Cal State Monterey Bay began.</p>
<p>The opportunity to create a new university drew some of the most
dedicated, creative and talented people in the field of higher
education to Monterey Bay. We reverently refer to them as the
founders.</p>
<p>In a few short months, that team adopted the Vision Statement,
which set out our core values, educational philosophy, and defines
what we aspire to be.</p>
<p>August 28, 1995 marked
the first day of classes, and as our pioneer alums can attest, the
campus was still a bit rough around the edges.&#xA0;Even so,
then-president Bill Clinton paid a visit to the university&apos;s
opening dedication ceremony. The entrepreneurial spirit and
camaraderie that those early classes embodied still exists on
campus &#x2014; students are empowered to get involved,&#xA0;start things
up&#xA0;and grab every opportunity they can imagine, so that CSUMB
reflects them and their passions&#xA0;as much as it makes a
difference in their lives.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, CSUMB continued to grow and evolve.
We got new majors. We added athletic teams competing&#xA0;in more
sports. Brand new state-of-the-art classroom buildings and
residence halls went up, and we started getting attention and
recognition for what we had accomplished &#x2014; our Service Learning
program was highlighted in U.S. News, Intel praised our wireless
accessibility, and the team of scholars who accredited us said, &quot;It
is our view that CSUMB is a product of scholarship at its best &#x2014;
rigorous, ethical, socially responsible, and respectful of the
values and strengths of a diverse group of people who have adopted
a common vision and sense of purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, you&apos;ll
still find pieces of Fort Ord&apos;s military past across campus -- in
murals, in renovated buildings, and even in new buildings like the
Alumni &amp; Visitors Center (the lobby ceiling is made of wood
recycled from demolished Army barracks).&#xA0; You&apos;ll also find the
wisdom and creativity of the founders in the faculty (yes, many of
them still teach here) and&#xA0;in the curriculum. You&apos;ll enjoy
traditional events such as Earth Week&#xA0;and hangouts like the
BBC, started up by pioneer alumni.&#xA0;And you&apos;ll have a chance to
weave your own story into ours, and become a part of our history as
it unfolds.</p>
