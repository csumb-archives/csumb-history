<h5>Maria Bonilla-Giuriato</h5>
<p><strong>Then:</strong> Maria Bonilla-Giuriato&apos;s intriguing story
began with her work with then-Monterey County Supervisor Simon
Salinas. She was involved in several meetings related to the design
process of CSUMB before the university came to be. Bonilla-Giuriato
then enrolled at CSUMB in 1998 in order to complete a degree with
Human Communication (HCOM) in Practical Professional Ethics; at the
time she was a mother of two small children and working full-time
for the Supervisor.</p>
<p>Just prior to her graduation, Maria Bonilla-Giuriato&apos;s Senior
Capstone project, &quot;Farmworkers Housing &amp; Health Needs
Assessment&quot; was presented to the campus community. Originally, she
was given funding from Monterey County to research the project,
which involved interviewing a variety of migrant workers and
gauging their housing and health needs. Soon the report was a
revenue generator, being presented to both Santa Cruz and Monterey
counties.</p>
<p>The project was also honored with special recognition in Long
Beach at the Postdoctoral Research Awards. The report brought great
awareness to the surrounding communities about issues surrounding
farmworkers and immigrants. But Bonilla-Giuriato, born in
Castroville and the daughter of farmworker parents, didn&apos;t stop
there: She won the Tri-County Achievement (co-recipient with
Juanita Lopez), then began working for Monterey County, which led
to her present career.</p>
<p><strong>Now:</strong> Maria Bonilla-Giuriato is now Community
Relations Manager with Monterey County&apos;s Department of Social and
Employment Services. She has served in this capacity for the last
three years, and is responsible for overseeing policy related to
housing and health. She&apos;s also an elected official, having been
elected to the city council (District 5) in Salinas, her current
home.</p>
<p>Bonilla-Giuriato still manages to mentor two to three CSUMB
students each year, helping them overcome obstacles, guiding them
through the college process and eventually helping them find
employment after graduation-always encouraging them to get involved
in the community like their mentor.</p>
<p>She describes CSUMB as &quot;an extraordinary place, providing
empowerment&quot; to all those willing to be encouraged. &quot;Being part of
CSUMB encouraged me to get involved, and encourages me today as a
parent.&quot;</p>
<p>Her next step may be the Panetta Institute&apos;s master&apos;s of public
policy.</p>
<h5>Guadalupe Serrano</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: Guadalupe Serrano was born in Mexico and
raised in Watsonville from the age of three. Serrano completed her
GED requirements some time after having left school, having
completed only the seventh grade. By the time she decided to enroll
at CSUMB in the year 2000, Guadalupe Serrano had been married for
10 years, was working full-time, and was a mother of four. Her
accomplishments at CSUMB included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provost Award winner in 2002</li>
<li>2002 Liberal Studies graduate</li>
<li>Enrolled (and later interned) in the teacher credential
program</li>
<li>One of 25 to get teacher credential in 2003</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;I remember the (CSUMB) ads were really positive,&quot; she recalls.
&quot;It was great because I didn&apos;t have to commute; it was so close. My
goal was to get my B.A. in two years.&quot;</p>
<p>After achieving that goal, Guadalupe enrolled in the teacher
credential program and later became an intern with Delberta Meyers.
&quot;She was very supportive,&quot; Serrano said. &quot;She knew what kind of
hectic schedules we were all doing. She knew the pathway we
(students) needed; she provided seminars and really paved the way
for us.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: Guadalupe has been serving the Echo Valley
School District in Prunedale as a bilingual, third-grade teacher
for the past three years.</p>
<p>She describes her CSUMB experiences as &quot;very positive. I loved
all the faculty there. I think they have a wonderful program
because they really prepare you for what you&apos;re going for.&quot;</p>
