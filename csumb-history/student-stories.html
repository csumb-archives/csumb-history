<h5>Luke Archer</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: Luke Archer is a 1999 Graduate in IMIE
(now the School of Business), with honors. After attempts at
earning a degree at several universities, Archer traveled to
Israel. Upon returning to the U.S., he began working in
construction. He met a CSUMB student (on a Service Learning
assignment) at a job site, and became intrigued enough to try
college life again.</p>
<p>&quot;I went to three different universities. I had literally quit
college because I didn&apos;t know what I wanted to do. I knew I needed
a business background, so I came to CSUMB because I heard you could
develop your own curriculum, your own program. Three weeks into it,
I met Dr. [Peter] Hackbert. We worked on several projects over the
years.&quot; Archer&apos;s accomplishments and activities while at CSUMB
included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started QuestPlus program</li>
<li>Involved with a mentor through Service Learning (thanks to Dr.
Hackbert)</li>
<li>Service Learning Project (lasting three years) at L&amp;O
Artichokes in Castroville</li>
</ul>
<p>Luke Archer&apos;s internship at L&amp;O proved to be as valuable as
the CSUMB education. Archer wrote the company&apos;s business plan,
formulated the sales &amp; marketing plan, and revised several
vital internal documents to help the company grow. &quot;Everything I
was doing for work (at L&amp;O) I was doing for school. I got the
education because I was ready for it, and because I&apos;d finally
bridged the gap between school and the work environment.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: A mentorship with Chris McKay, the
originator of Top Line Toys, led to the beginning of a business
partnership upon Archer&apos;s graduation in 1999. The two have been
working together ever since.</p>
<p>After three incarnations, they formulated Just Enough, a company
based on the Central Coast that has five music-instruction products
geared toward teens (sold in high-end retail stores nationwide),
and which also has a new product that serves as a pathway for
independent musicians to compete with the &quot;big boys&quot;. Over the
years, the company has employed several CSUMB grads.</p>
<h5>Julie Uretsky</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: Julie Uretsky, a 1995 transfer student
from Monterey Peninsula College and mother of three young children,
took 14 years to finish an associate&apos;s degree, taking one class per
semester. Uretsky then decided to go to CSUMB because her family
obligations made it too difficult to travel to San Jose State
University. After writing a letter in hope of being admitted to
CSUMB, she enrolled in the Liberal Studies major. Uretsky later
changed to the Collaborative Health &amp; Human Services, or CHHS
(then known as CHS) major. After beginning to attend classes
full-time in 1998 &amp; 1999, Uretsky received her degree in
1999.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember one of the first classes I had was with Dr. William
Franklin,&quot; Julie recalls. &quot;It required a lot of studying, research
for papers, and I remember it being really hard. But I got an &apos;A&apos;
on the term paper and an &apos;A&apos; for the class-after that I knew I
could take anything out there. No matter how hard it might be. Dr.
Franklin was very encouraging, and I remember how motivating all
that was.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: Julie Uretsky is now an Associate Planner
for the City of Pacific Grove, managing the city&apos;s low-income
housing programs. An employee of the city in various capacities
since 1981, Julie&apos;s internship during the last semesters of her
CSUMB days led to her assume a position directly related to her
internship and degree. Soon thereafter, her then-supervisor retired
and Uretsky moved up to that position, where she remains today.
&quot;There&apos;s no way I could have done it without a B.A. degree,&quot; she
asserts.</p>
<p>&quot;Every instructor . . . they didn&apos;t stand up there and just
lecture and bore you to death. They facilitated real learning; they
turned what they were talking about into real-world stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The very first class I had was at the elementary school
(Stillwell) and there was no heating. You knew it (the
inconvenience of no real classrooms) was all temporary. I didn&apos;t
care where I was; I just wanted an education. Things kept changing
early on; requirements for graduation kept changing. They (CSUMB
officials) said that you were going to have to be in charge of your
education. I had to learn to keep everything and plan really well.
It was the best thing for me because I&apos;m a planner now. It was kind
of an extra bonus for going to CSUMB.&quot;</p>
<p>Two of Uretsky&apos;s children are college students today.</p>
<h5>Steven Russell</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: Steven Russell, a Visual &amp; Public
Arts (VPA) major, graduated from CSUMB in 1999. As a boy, Russell
spent two years in the late 1980s living on Fort Ord while his
father finished out his military career. &quot;I was here when it was a
fully operational military community,&quot; he explains. &quot;There were
something like 35,000 to 45,000 families. Fort Ord, at one point,
housed a population greater than Seaside or Marina. Now things have
changed.&quot;</p>
<p>While attending Monterey Peninsula College, Russell went to hear
Suzanne Lacy, Luis Valdez, and Amalia Mesa-Bains speak to
prospective CSUMB students. He was inspired by Mesa-Bains&apos; vision
for the Visual &amp; Public Arts program, and he enrolled the
following semester.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw a lot of possibilities with the open space on Fort Ord;
I&apos;m a visual artist and [the fort&apos;s open space] was a real bonus to
me. From Amalia Mesa-Bains&apos; coming to talk to me, I saw
opportunities to help build my own curriculum at VPA.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon arriving on campus, Russell made the most of his
opportunities. For example, he:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spent one year abroad studying in Florence, Italy (1999)</li>
<li>Was recruited to be community liaison by RUAP (Reciprocal
University for the Arts Program), serving in that capacity for one
year</li>
<li>Went back to teach at the same middle school he attended as a
boy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: Steven Russell is an Opportunity
Instructor at Fitch Middle School in Seaside, helping kids (12- to
14-year-olds) with problems with truancy or grades to focus on five
core subjects in one classroom setting: math, sciences, social
studies, language, and reading.</p>
<p>&quot;My years at CSUMB were full of rich experiences. Professors
took the time to give mentorship and guidance. I created really
strong relationships with student colleagues and the professors-it
was more peer-to-peer than hierarchical. And the administrators
were very involved in creating a solid community. It was great to
be part of a strong community that allowed different perspectives.
The students were really given ownership of the campus. I think
it&apos;s good to point out-and for CSUMB to remember-that colleges
exist because of students, and not to get away from that.&quot;</p>
