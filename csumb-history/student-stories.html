  	     <h5>Luke Archer</h5>

<p><strong>Then</strong>: Luke Archer is a 1999 Graduate in IMIE (now the School of Business), with honors. After attempts at earning a degree at several universities, Archer traveled to Israel. Upon returning to the U.S., he began working in construction. He met a CSUMB student (on a Service Learning assignment) at a job site, and became intrigued enough to try college life again.</p>

<p>&quot;I went to three different universities. I had literally quit college because I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do. I knew I needed a business background, so I came to CSUMB because I heard you could develop your own curriculum, your own program. Three weeks into it, I met Dr. [Peter] Hackbert. We worked on several projects over the years.&quot;  Archer&#39;s accomplishments and activities while at CSUMB included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Started QuestPlus program</li>

  <li>Involved with a mentor through Service Learning (thanks to Dr. Hackbert)</li>

  <li>Service Learning Project (lasting three years) at L&amp;O Artichokes in Castroville</li>
</ul>

<p>Luke Archer&#39;s internship at L&amp;O proved to be as valuable as the CSUMB education. Archer wrote the company&#39;s business plan, formulated the sales &amp; marketing plan, and revised several vital internal documents to help the company grow.  &quot;Everything I was doing for work (at L&amp;O) I was doing for school. I got the education because I was ready for it, and because I&#39;d finally bridged the gap between school and the work environment.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong>: A mentorship with Chris McKay, the originator of Top Line Toys, led to the beginning of a business partnership upon Archer&#39;s graduation in 1999. The two have been working together ever since.</p>

<p>After three incarnations, they formulated Just Enough, a company based on the Central Coast that has five music-instruction products geared toward teens (sold in high-end retail stores nationwide), and which also has a new product that serves as a pathway for independent musicians to compete with the &quot;big boys&quot;. Over the years, the company has employed several CSUMB grads.</p>

<h5>Julie Uretsky</h5>

<p><strong>Then</strong>: Julie Uretsky, a 1995 transfer student from Monterey Peninsula College and mother of three young children, took 14 years to finish an associate&#39;s degree, taking one class per semester. Uretsky then decided to go to CSUMB because her family obligations made it too difficult to travel to San Jose State University. After writing a letter in hope of being admitted to CSUMB, she enrolled in the Liberal Studies major.  Uretsky later changed to the Collaborative Health &amp; Human Services, or CHHS (then known as CHS) major. After beginning to attend classes full-time in 1998 &amp; 1999, Uretsky received her degree in 1999.</p>

<p>&quot;I remember one of the first classes I had was with Dr. William Franklin,&quot; Julie recalls. &quot;It required a lot of studying, research for papers, and I remember it being really hard. But I got an &#39;A&#39; on the term paper and an &#39;A&#39; for the class-after that I knew I could take anything out there. No matter how hard it might be. Dr. Franklin was very encouraging, and I remember how motivating all that was.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong>: Julie Uretsky is now an Associate Planner for the City of Pacific Grove, managing the city&#39;s low-income housing programs. An employee of the city in various capacities since 1981, Julie&#39;s internship during the last semesters of her CSUMB days led to her assume a position directly related to her internship and degree. Soon thereafter, her then-supervisor retired and Uretsky moved up to that position, where she remains today. &quot;There&#39;s no way I could have done it without a B.A. degree,&quot; she asserts.</p>

<p>&quot;Every instructor . . . they didn&#39;t stand up there and just lecture and bore you to death. They facilitated real learning; they turned what they were talking about into real-world stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The very first class I had was at the elementary school (Stillwell) and there was no heating. You knew it (the inconvenience of no real classrooms) was all temporary. I didn&#39;t care where I was; I just wanted an education. Things kept changing early on; requirements for graduation kept changing. They (CSUMB officials) said that you were going to have to be in charge of your education. I had to learn to keep everything and plan really well. It was the best thing for me because I&#39;m a planner now. It was kind of an extra bonus for going to CSUMB.&quot;</p>

<p>Two of Uretsky&#39;s children are college students today.</p>

<h5>Steven Russell</h5>

<p><strong>Then</strong>: Steven Russell, a Visual &amp; Public Arts (VPA) major, graduated from CSUMB in 1999.  As a boy, Russell spent two years in the late 1980s living on Fort Ord while his father finished out his military career. &quot;I was here when it was a fully operational military community,&quot; he explains. &quot;There were something like 35,000 to 45,000 families. Fort Ord, at one point, housed a population greater than Seaside or Marina. Now things have changed.&quot;</p>

<p>While attending Monterey Peninsula College, Russell went to hear Suzanne Lacy, Luis Valdez, and Amalia Mesa-Bains speak to prospective CSUMB students. He was inspired by Mesa-Bains&#39; vision for the Visual &amp; Public Arts program, and he enrolled the following semester.</p>

<p>&quot;I saw a lot of possibilities with the open space on Fort Ord; I&#39;m a visual artist and [the fort&#39;s open space] was a real bonus to me. From Amalia Mesa-Bains&#39; coming to talk to me, I saw opportunities to help build my own curriculum at VPA.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon arriving on campus, Russell made the most of his opportunities. For example, he:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spent one year abroad studying in Florence, Italy (1999)</li>

  <li>Was recruited to be community liaison by RUAP (Reciprocal University for the Arts Program), serving in that capacity for one year</li>

  <li>Went back to teach at the same middle school he attended as a boy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now</strong>: Steven Russell is an Opportunity Instructor at Fitch Middle School in Seaside, helping kids (12- to 14-year-olds) with problems with truancy or grades to focus on five core subjects in one classroom setting: math, sciences, social studies, language, and reading.</p>

<p>&quot;My years at CSUMB were full of rich experiences. Professors took the time to give mentorship and guidance. I created really strong relationships with student colleagues and the professors-it was more peer-to-peer than hierarchical. And the administrators were very involved in creating a solid community. It was great to be part of a strong community that allowed different perspectives. The students were really given ownership of the campus. I think it&#39;s good to point out-and for CSUMB to remember-that colleges exist because of students, and not to get away from that.&quot;</p>
