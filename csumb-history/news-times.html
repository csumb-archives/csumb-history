Some U.N. camps shelter civilians, but most of the U.N.
peacekeeping forces stand by while the slaughter goes on-they are
forbidden to intervene because this would breach their &quot;monitoring&quot;

responds, &quot;. . . the use of the term &apos;genocide&apos; has a very precise
legal meaning, although it&apos;s not strictly a legal determination.
There are other factors in there as well.&quot; However, a secret
intelligence report by the State Department issued as early as the
end of April calls the killings genocide. Two days later, the U.N.
Security Council passes a resolution condemning the killing, but
omits the word &quot;genocide.&quot; If the term is used, the U.N. will be
legally obliged to act to &quot;prevent and punish&quot; the
perpetrators.<br>
