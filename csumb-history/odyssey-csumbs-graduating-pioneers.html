<p>According to Webster&apos;s Dictionary, a pioneer is &quot;a person who
originates a new line of thought or activity; someone who starts or
leads others in the development of something new or anyone who
ventures into the unknown.&quot;</p>
<p>The 33 Pioneers did just that four years ago. CSUMB graduates
291 seniors this year, 33 of whom are &quot;Pioneer&quot; students. (To be
considered a &quot;Pioneer,&quot; the student must have started his or her
college career as a freshman at CSUMB in August of 1995, when CSUMB
opened for its first semester.)</p>
<p>When the school opened in 1995, students found out just how
&quot;new&quot; this school really was: they moved into the lone residence
hall only hours after the last bit of dust had been swept
up&amp;#8212and, they say, while the paint was still drying. Their
first CSUMB meals had to be catered because there was, as yet, no
on-campus grill. The pioneers persevered, often having to travel
off campus to attend their first CSUMB classes at a local
elementary school (until CSUMB&apos;s classrooms were finished a few
weeks into the semester).</p>
<p>CSUMB&apos;s opening was full of firsts. Pioneers were the first
students ever to have an otter as a mascot; they were also the
first in the nation to live on a vacant army base as students. The
day of orientation, the bookstore opened with the first set of
brand new books and supplies. The first CSUMB T-shirts and
sweatshirts were swept off the shelves as enthusiastic students and
their parents searched for the CSUMB identity they would help to
create. New email accounts were assigned to CSUMB&apos;s first 654
students.</p>
<p>The day after they arrived, the Pioneers headed northward to
attend the first-ever Otter Days, hosted by Outward Bound in the
Santa Cruz Mountains. Several days later, on September 5, 1995,
they came back to the inauguration of the new university with
President Bill Clinton as guest of honor at the opening of the 21st
CSU campus. The pioneers led their fellow Otters by participating
in every aspect of the university, including sitting on committees
to give input on everything from graduation requirements to
landscaping. They even participated in search committees
responsible for choosing faculty members for the future.</p>
