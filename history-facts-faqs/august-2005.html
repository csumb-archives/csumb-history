<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Welcome everyone to the 2005-2006 State of the University
Address, including our special guests from the community. Thanks
for taking the time to be here.</p>
<p>This is a change from previous years when the State of the
University Address was delivered in January. Since this is my
interim year it seemed appropriate to set the stage at the
BEGINNING of the academic year rather than half way through.</p>
<p>There is significant work that needs to begin now and continue
as we move forward into the next 10 years at CSUMB. This is a
critical time in the maturing of our institution, a time when our
character must shine through.</p>
<p>We begin this new academic year with some new faces in the
family and-speaking of character shining through-some seasoned
veterans in fresh roles. So, I would like to start by introducing
some of these individuals who have joined the Campus Leadership
Team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interim Provost-Marsha Moroh</li>
<li>Vice President for Student Affairs-Sue Borrego from University
of Arkansas</li>
<li>Administrator in Charge for University Advancement-Steve
Reed</li>
<li>Associate Vice President for Institutional Effectiveness-Lynne
Stamoulis from University of Hawaii, Hilo</li>
<li>Associate Vice President for Academic Planning, Research, and
Graduate Studies-Wynetta Lee from Dillard University in New
Orleans</li>
<li>Interim Dean of the College of Science, Media Arts and
Technology-Rikk Kvitek</li>
<li>Interim Dean of the College of Professional Studies-Sandy
Hale</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I would be remiss if I didn&apos;t introduce the three
ongoing members of the President&apos;s Cabinet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vice President for Administration and Finance-Dan Johnson</li>
<li>Chief Information Officer-Gil Gonzales</li>
<li>Executive Director of the Foundation-Kevin Saunders</li>
</ul>
<p>Deep thanks to the leaders who have stepped up from their
current administrative and faculty roles to support their colleges
and divisions during this transition and to those in ongoing roles,
and welcome to all of our new people. What they and we all share is
a commitment to the CSUMB Vision, and a commitment to continuing
the hard work of making that Vision a reality.</p>
<h5>The Vision Statement</h5>
<p>Some have suggested that, as Interim President, it is my role to
hold the campus together during this time of transition. That is
simply not the case. You see, CSUMB has never reflected a single
person, nor even a small group of people. What shapes this campus
and holds it together is the Vision Statement. Our Vision is about
serving the historically underserved, the first generation college
students, the children of the working class, the children of
farmworkers. Our vision is about a university education designed
around learning-learning in a setting dedicated to our diverse
communities, our technological generation, and our global
community, and around service to our community, social
responsibility, and social justice. It is the foundation of who we
are. It is what draws us here. It held us together through some
tumultuous years. And it is what binds us together today during
this time of transition. The Western Association of Schools and
Colleges team recognized our Vision during our accreditation
review, when they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its founding, the university has defined and articulated a
Vision Statement that has been carefully crafted to become the core
of the institution&apos;s functioning and the organizing basis for
participation in the university community.</p>
<p>The Vision Statement is real and has deep personal meaning to
members of the campus community.</p>
<p>The institution is as much vision-driven as it is
outcomes-based.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, as WASC noted, the Vision has always been what drives
us individually so that we, in turn, collectively drive the
university closer to that Vision. This transition year should be no
different.</p>
<h5>Moving Forward</h5>
<p>A time of transition can be unsettling, but it can also be
exciting, bringing renewed vision for the future. My hope for this
year is to use my interim presidency to move the campus forward in
several critical areas that touch on every division and every
member of the campus community. Some of you have already heard me
mention these as my mantra, but I will repeat them here and then
further describe how they are strategically integral to CSUMB&apos;s
plans.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, renew the strategic plan.</li>
<li>Second, raise funds for the library.</li>
<li>Third, gain all necessary approvals to begin our staff/faculty
housing project.</li>
<li>Fourth, improve graduation rates.</li>
<li>And fifth, improve our business practices on campus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because all plans and priorities should tie to the strategic
plan, today I will talk about the latter four goals in the context
of the first and foremost priority-renewal of the strategic
plan.</p>
<h5>Strategic Plan Renewal</h5>
<p>When I came here six years ago, one of the most important tasks
given to me was to lead the campus in drafting our first strategic
plan. We recognized at that time that it was critical to have this
first strategic plan represent the CSUMB Vision Statement. It was a
way to hold ourselves accountable to actualizing our lofty vision
in tangible ways by identifying specific target outcomes and
indicators of their achievement.</p>
<p>What I am going to share with you this morning is the first
comprehensive progress report on our strategic plan. We have
evaluated the indicators to determine where we have excelled and
where we still have challenges.</p>
<p>Why is this important?</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, to challenge ourselves-to reflect and examine how
well we are living the Vision</li>
<li>Also-God forbid-for reaffirmation of our WASC
accreditation</li>
<li>And, perhaps most importantly, to share with presidential
candidates who we are, what we&apos;re striving to achieve, and how
we&apos;re doing</li>
</ul>
<p>First, a little history for those who are relatively new to
CSUMB and didn&apos;t experience the strategic planning process
firsthand.</p>
<p>A team of faculty, staff, students, and community members came
together and, using the Vision Statement as a starting point,
further refined seven previously articulated academic core values
as guideposts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied, active, and project-based learning activities</li>
<li>Interdisciplinarity</li>
<li>Multicultural and global perspectives</li>
<li>Technological sophistication</li>
<li>Service learning</li>
<li>Ethical reflection and practice</li>
<li>Collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p>We then crafted our mission statement based on the Vision and
core academic values:</p>
<p>To build a multicultural learning community founded on academic
excellence from which all partners in the educational process
emerge prepared to contribute productively, responsibly, and
ethically to California and the global community.</p>
<p>Then, ultimately, we finalized a strategic plan built around
four themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSUMB is a Pluralistic Academic Community.</li>
<li>CSUMB is committed to Student Learning.</li>
<li>CSUMB provides Support for Learning.</li>
<li>CSUMB is an Engaged Campus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the past three years and continuing with this year, the
Provost-that&apos;s me in my former life-and the Administrative Council
have selected a theme for the year to guide priority setting and
budget development for the entire campus, and to make the strategic
themes evident in all planning efforts-enrollment, academic,
financial, and capital. Even our campus master plan reflects our
strategic themes.</p>
<p>We also began to gather evidence to support and reflect our
progress. Today we have preliminary data on all of our strategic
themes. This progress report provides a baseline of data for the
renewal process.</p>
<p>This year, we will convene a strategic plan renewal committee
comprised of faculty, staff, students, and community members, using
the Institutional Effectiveness Subcommittee of the Administrative
Council as the base of operations. Our new Academic Affairs AVPs,
the Provost, and Institutional Assessment and Research will lead
this effort.</p>
<p>So, what do we know thus far? I am going to provide some
highlights-by no means the entire report-of what we have discovered
based on the evidence gathered.</p>
<p>As data sources we used WASC accreditation documentation; our
National Survey of Student Engagement data; student satisfaction
surveys; alumni surveys; Center for Teaching, Learning, and
Assessment information; Human Resources data; Admissions &amp;
Records data; and focus group information gathered by Institutional
Assessment and Research. You can find all of this evidence on the
CSUMB.EDU/data webpages.</p>
<h6>Student Learning</h6>
<p>The student learning theme reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Effective and meaningful student learning is the primary focus
at CSUMB. As a comprehensive public institution of higher learning
in 21st century California, CSUMB commits to helping California&apos;s
students develop and expand the range of knowledge and skills they
will need to support themselves, their families, and their
communities in a rapidly evolving world. In particular, graduates
of CSUMB will have the interdisciplinary perspective and lifelong
learning skills needed to adapt to the unpredictable opportunities
and challenges that lie ahead. They will have a global perspective
and a combination of collaborative skills, language abilities,
cross-cultural competencies, and technological capabilities that
will enable them to contribute positively to an increasingly
interconnected and interdependent world. They will understand the
value of community service and ethical reflection in both their
personal and professional lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the areas where we are making good progress:</p>
<p>We know that our students have consistent access to outstanding
teachers and outstanding teaching practices as resources to help
them learn outcomes effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>We know that students actually achieve stated outcomes.</p>
<p>Teaching approaches develop problem-solving awareness and skills
for contemporary and real-world application, whether it is mapping
the sea floor, creating a business plan for Dorothy&apos;s Kitchen, or
participating in a real archeological dig in a California
mission.</p>
<p>We know that the core values and elements of the Vision
Statement are reflected in our learning outcomes.</p>
<p>And, most importantly, current students and alumni recognize and
appreciate the value of their CSUMB education.</p>
<p>The areas where we are making slow progress and still face
challenges include:</p>
<p>Some of our course outcomes are not adequately aligned with
Major Learning Outcomes or University Learning requirements, and
therefore not necessarily aligned with the knowledge and skills
valued by our graduates and society.</p>
<p>It also does not appear in the evidence that CSUMB solicits,
welcomes, and responds to feedback from stakeholders to the extent
that we would want. Our teaching methods still do not address all
the different learning needs and styles of our diverse student body
and, furthermore, faculty do not feel that they are empowered to
improve the state of the art in teaching. We need to look into this
more carefully. The question remains: Is it a need for more
professional support for faculty, or are there other issues that
need to be addressed?</p>
<p>Another area we need to explore is whether students connect new
ideas and skills to prior knowledge and experiences, and feel that
others recognize and value their prior knowledge and experiences.
This speaks directly to our valuing the assets that students bring
with them to the learning environment.</p>
<p>One of the priorities that I have listed for this year-improving
graduation rates-aligns with this theme. This is a CSU systemwide
effort that has been identified by the trustees as the highest of
priorities. It is understood that we serve diverse students many of
whom have multiple challenges and responsibilities such as work and
family obligations. We can do better by illuminating and smoothing
the pathways to graduation for them. Only in this way can the CSU
continue to offer California&apos;s burgeoning college-eligible
population the opportunity for higher education.</p>
<p>We need to reflect on our Major Learning Outcomes, course
outcomes, and University Learning Requirements to ensure that our
students are able to effectively navigate through to the degree.
Toward that end, Dan Fernandez, our Academic Senate chair, led
faculty work on this during the summer. Their efforts reflect our
clear commitment to student learning.</p>
<h6>Support for Learning</h6>
<p>The Support for Learning theme reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CSUMB Vision includes &apos;an academic community where all teach
and learn from one another in an atmosphere of mutual respect.&apos; As
such, faculty and staff members join students in a broader category
of &apos;learners.&apos; CSUMB commits to supporting learners from diverse
backgrounds in every aspect of their education. For students, this
support manifests through an effective student-centered educational
experience which leverages the assets that students possess. The
primary goal is to help students obtain their desired degrees or
credentials. Thus, the collaborative design of academic,
administrative, and student support services promotes
retention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The highlights for this theme include:</p>
<p>We have learned that we support the development of each faculty
member&apos;s endeavor in the scholarship of teaching as a foundation to
CSUMB&apos;s innovative pedagogy. This is most clearly evident in our
retention, tenure, and promotion guidelines.</p>
<p>A plan for growing the university&apos;s non-state funding to
supplement resources from traditional state funding sources has
been articulated. In fact, for our size and faculty numbers, we far
exceed expectations in the amount of grant dollars generated by our
faculty.</p>
<p>The area of slow progress where we need to focus more energy is
working harder at successfully delivering academic and personal
success services to all CSUMB learners. This reflects what we have
called the run-around factor. We have been working on this and saw
considerable improvement with the advent of the Campus Service
Center, but it is an area that still needs a lot of work. We are
also committed to serving the historically underserved, and this
requires us to focus efforts and resources to ensure that all
students are successful.</p>
<p>The priority for this year on the theme of support for learning
is specifically focused on the new Tanimura &amp; Antle Family
Memorial Library. I will be working with University Advancement and
the President&apos;s Council in a fundraising campaign to build the kind
of library that will be cultivating learning and discovery long
into the future. If you haven&apos;t seen the plans, visit the
CSUMB.EDU/library website to read more, and to watch the 3D
flythrough created by three of our TMAC students and faculty member
Pat Watson. It is an amazing example of the work that our students
and faculty do together.</p>
<p>What I need to share with you this morning, and I know many of
you have heard, the bids came back for the library $10 million over
budget. Because we are committed to going forward with this
important facility with minimum delay, Niraj Dangoria and his team
are working with the architects to right size the building to bring
it back to the budget figure while still ensuring that it will
serve campus needs for next 25-30 years. Niraj will be talking more
about the library in his presentation later this morning.</p>
<p>This important building project and related fundraising campaign
is a continuing priority that truly represents support for
learning.</p>
<h6>Engaged Campus</h6>
<p>The next theme, an engaged campus, is one of the hallmarks of
the CSUMB experience.</p>
<p>The CSUMB Vision Statement declares a commitment to service
learning and a focus on the preparation of students for active
citizenship in a diverse society. Our University Learning
Requirements, Graduation Learning Outcomes, and outcomes-based
model reflect values of service, social justice, responsibility,
compassion, and ethics. Faculty pedagogy furthers the
civic-engagement agenda with an emphasis on reflection,
constructivist approaches, and field-based learning that will
engage the learner personally with the curriculum.</p>
<p>In the community, CSUMB has developed and sustains partnerships
with K-12 schools and community colleges in our region. Nationally,
the Panetta Institute offers opportunities for civic engagement.
Internationally, Extended Education and our Office of International
Programs are developing new opportunities for students and faculty,
building on efforts already underway in Mexico and Japan.</p>
<p>One internal aspect of engagement is CSUMB&apos;s commitment to
institutional renewal and improvement through a process of
assessment within a culture of evidence, which is exactly what the
Strategic Plan progress report is all about.</p>
<p>The outcomes where we can point to significant progress are:</p>
<p>The campus appropriately and relevantly links to conditions of
the community.</p>
<p>Our students do significant applied-learning projects in our
surrounding communities-in business, in science, in the arts, and
in literacy development to name only a few.</p>
<p>The university engages with local communities in the development
of a seamless multicultural university village. Our World Theater
Performing Arts program is but one example of this.</p>
<p>Curriculum, pedagogy, and scholarly activities further civic
engagement and the service learning agenda. And commitment to
service learning is sustained as the campus grows.</p>
<p>The area where the campus is still slow in making recognizable
progress is related to governance. We are striving to have a model
of representational decision making and governance-diverse in
approaches and efforts, and supported financially-resulting from
faculty, staff, and student engagement. We have come a long way in
becoming more transparent in our decision making and shared
governance in the past five years, with faculty, staff, students,
administrators, and community members participating in all major
planning activities on campus. But we still have a way to go to
achieve our aspirations for a model of shared governance that is
explicit and transparent.</p>
<p>For this interim year, as stated earlier, one of my priorities
directly related to this theme is to work with the Cabinet on
improving how we do business with each other on campus. There are
business practices that worked very well for us when we were a
small startup operation, but, now that we are a growing and
maturing institution, some of these practices are not serving us as
well. For example the blending of Foundation and university
stateside operations has caused concern among faculty who have
grants. The issue of chargebacks has also raised its head and needs
to be resolved in an explicit and transparent manner. These issues
will be addressed starting at the Cabinet level and through the
administrative council. Plans and recommendations will be
communicated broadly so that we will all be working from the same
page, moving forward as an engaged campus.</p>
<h6>Pluralistic Academic Community</h6>
<p>The final theme, a Pluralistic Academic Community, is the
highlighted theme for 2005-2006. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In CSUMB&apos;s model pluralistic academic community, diversity
enriches the learning and life experience of all. Learners grow and
teach one another in an atmosphere of mutual respect, share a
strong sense of personal and community identity, and make an honest
commitment to being responsible for creating and maintaining a safe
environment. Ours is an inclusive community that values and
maximizes the contributions of its members and reflects this
assets-based approach in administrative practices, outreach to
historically underserved students, and development of learning
experiences that expose its members to the knowledge,
understandings, and realities of other cultures and perspectives.
The development of mutual respect for different ways of knowing is
the bedrock of our celebration of diversity as we develop the
pluralistic academic community of California State University,
Monterey Bay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The areas where CSUMB can point to significant progress are the
following:</p>
<p>The student body includes significant Tri-County and state
representation, and an increasing international presence, and
campus trends indicate improvement in cross-cultural attitude,
sensitivity to issues, and increased awareness and participation in
campus initiatives to enhance a pluralistic community.</p>
<p>Areas where we&apos;re making slow progress are:</p>
<p>We are still working on the exploration and research of
appropriate characteristics and thresholds to be reflected within
our student body, staff, faculty, and administration. These have
yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Curriculum and pedagogy have been improved by maximizing our
community talents. However, our evidence does not indicate this as
a strength yet.</p>
<p>As noted under the student learning theme, our curriculum and
pedagogy do not yet embody an assets-based framework to the extent
that we would want.</p>
<p>And finally, with regard to staff, faculty, and administration,
retention and success trends indicate that we are still challenged
by the high cost of living in relation to our salaries. We also
need to continue to monitor our diversity thresholds and to assure
ourselves that we maintain a supportive campus environment that
reflects our Vision.</p>
<p>Overall, for the goals and outcomes on the theme of Pluralistic
Academic Community our progress has been moderate. Our population
is moving toward reflecting the demographics of our region. Our
curriculum and pedagogy generally reflect the realities of the
diverse cultures of our communities. And, our overall climate, as
reflected in our student retention rates, is okay. But we need to
work diligently to make it better, and we need to pay particular
attention to our staff, faculty, and administration retention
rates. We lost a significant number of faculty and staff this past
year to jobs that paid more and were in areas where the cost of
living is much lower.</p>
<p>This is where my priority of gaining all necessary approvals to
begin our housing project comes in. We accomplished one major step
in July when the trustees gave schematic approval. We still need to
achieve approval for the financing in January before we can break
ground. This rates as a high priority for me because we need to
provide more staff and faculty housing with options that make it
affordable for good people to come here to work, and to stay here
until the work is done. After all, our pluralistic academic
community has a Vision to achieve!</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Six years ago when I joined this campus community, the
university was at a critical point in its development, a time when
there was fear and concern that the purpose that this campus had
set out for itself was slipping away. The one thing that was
unwavering through those tumultuous times was the Vision. It was
the rallying cry; it was the unifying force; it was the glue that
kept this place together.</p>
<p>Following my arrival, we spent 18 months planning the work
needed to really operationalize the Vision, and we have spent
nearly five more years working the plan. As the Strategic Plan
progress report indicates, all of the planning and working is
slowly paying off.</p>
<p>This is a campus that has been maturing around its commitment to
its Vision, and it is that maturity that ensures a smooth
transition from its founding president, through my interim term, to
the next president. Today, in a different context and in a
different time, the Vision will carry us through this transition as
it carried the campus through its early development. While the
strategic plan represents the hands and feet of action, the Vision
is the heart and soul of CSUMB. It is the Vision that draws us. It
is the Vision that DRIVES us. Thus, as another priority added to my
short list, I will work to renew our commitment to and honoring of
the Vision. Toward that end, I hereby exercise my interim
presidential powers to declare that, starting today, we will refer
to this place that we love and serve with two powerful words noted
in the WASC report-VISION DRIVEN. Yes, CSUMB has always been and
will forever remain-<strong>VISION DRIVEN</strong>.</p>
