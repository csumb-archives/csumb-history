<h4>Transcript</h4>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Good morning, friends and colleagues. And, welcome to our
special guests from the community. Thanks for taking the time to be
here.</p>
<p>As I sat where you are sitting a couple months ago at the
Tenth-Anniversary Distinguished Lecture by Victor
Villase&#xF1;or-listening to the rage and the hope, the story and the
wisdom that emerged from it-I was powerfully reminded of our
purpose at CSUMB, the importance of never taking that purpose for
granted, and the need to extend our impact to future generations of
learners.</p>
<p>In 2001, as part of our Strategic Plan, we collectively
articulated this purpose in our mission statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To build a multicultural learning community founded on academic
excellence from which all partners in the educational process
emerge prepared to contribute productively, responsibly, and
ethically to California and the global community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I stand before you for the tenth time to report on the state
of our university, I can confidently report that we do indeed
deliver on this mission. Each May, the graduates who parade across
the stadium platform serve as testament. They matriculate uniquely
and powerfully prepared to contribute to society thanks to our
learning community and processes.</p>
<p>This May I will join them in moving on. This will be my final
State of the University address. In a few months, I will embark on
a new journey as Assistant Director-General for Education at
UNESCO-the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization. As I go, I feel extraordinarily well prepared by what
we do here and by all of you to contribute productively,
responsibly, and ethically to the global community in my new role.
But before I continue with my prepared remarks, let me tell you how
I really feel: I love this university; I love you my colleagues,
within and beyond the university&apos;s boundaries; and I believe we
have achieved in ten short years something golden-far beyond what
we or others dared hope for.</p>
<p>Today, given that we are in the midst of recognizing our tenth
anniversary, I&apos;d like to start by taking a tour through our first
decade, recalling the people and forces that have contributed to
the establishment of this great university. Next, I will give you a
snapshot of the university we have become and what is happening
today to position us to successfully continue on our mission.
Finally, I will share some thinking about the focus for the next
few years as CSUMB continues to thrive and grow as a model of
community and learning in today&apos;s California and today&apos;s world.</p>
<h5>Looking Back</h5>
<h6>1994-1995-The Year of the Vision</h6>
<p>Though much prior work had been done by community members,
government officials, and our first employees, 1994-95 marks the
first year in our official history. At our Founders Day celebration
this past September, on an evening as chilling to our bones as it
was warming to our hearts, Dr. Marsha Moroh, one of our pioneer
faculty members and now Dean of the College of Science, Media Arts
and Technology, listed a series of the challenges faced that year.
You can read her insightful and humorous remarks on the anniversary
website. Rather than sharing them with you again today, I&apos;d like to
look back to the singular force of 1994-95 that motivated people to
persevere when things seemed impossible-the CSUMB Vision Statement.
In all of my years in government and higher education, I have never
seen another vision possessing such power. Since it was signed in
1994, the Vision Statement has shaped who we are and how we operate
with such influence that the Western Association of Schools and
Colleges team mentioned it repeatedly during our accreditation
process; several books have referenced it as a model; and our
faculty, staff, students, and alumni have used it as a rallying cry
and standard for performance. Because we were committed to the
CSUMB Vision in 1994-95, we believed in the power of education to
transform people&apos;s lives and we were united in our commitment to
create new opportunities for students in the Tri-County and all of
California. I will always remember &apos;94-&apos;95 as the Year of the
Vision.</p>
<h6>1995-1996-The Year of the Faculty</h6>
<p>But we moved from vision to reality when we opened our doors to
students in 1995-96. And it was a tough reality. As Marsha
recalled, some students were opening the boxes and networking the
computers that they would use in their own classrooms. Everyone was
dodging fresh paint to find classes in buildings with no signage.
Amid the clutter and confusion that year, a group of heroes arose:
the faculty. Regardless of the chaos and lack of planning time,
they could, and they did, flat out teach. The magic that the
faculty worked then has continued within our faculty ranks ever
since. It has been the lifeblood of the learning that defines
California State University, Monterey Bay.</p>
<h6>1996-1997-The Year of the Student</h6>
<p>Our students quickly became actively involved in our
development. They made an impact early and often. From the start,
we involved them in committees to hire, make decisions, and shape
their university. Many of the pioneer students came here for that
very purpose. By the second year, their creativity and initiative
really began to shine. In fact, that year, a group of students led
by Sara McClellan got together to recommend structure and content
that ultimately became our current University Learning
Requirements. When the first of our pioneer students received their
degrees at our inaugural Commencement Ceremony in May 1997, their
caps, gowns, smiles, tears, and words became permanently imprinted
in my mind. 1996-97 was truly the students&apos; year just as 1997-98
was the Year of the Staff.</p>
<h6>1997-1998-The Year of the Staff</h6>
<p>The staff worked diligently to make this place run throughout
the early years, but in 1997-98 the fruits of their continuous
effort behind the scenes really began to rise to prominence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our student recruitment staff put together an extremely
successful On-Campus Admissions Day.<br></li>
<li>The Student Activities staff helped students organize an
impressive list of clubs and slate of campus activities.<br></li>
<li>Conference and Event Services hosted nearly fifteen hundred
people at 23 events held on our campus.<br></li>
<li>And, the Development staff organized the first Celebration of
Community to raise funds for student scholarships.</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples could go on and on, just as our staff has gone on
and on serving students.</p>
<h6>1998-1999-The Year of the Community</h6>
<p>The community drove the creation of CSUMB, and we&apos;ve been
expanding our community connections ever since. But it was 1998-99
when the community weighed in at CSUMB.</p>
<ul>
<li>Together with our regional community colleges, we formed the
Higher Education Learning Partners to improve transfers to
CSUMB.<br></li>
<li>We dedicated the Panetta Institute for Public Policy on our
campus, formalizing a partnership that has brought informative
lectures, America Reads outreach, and expanded academic offerings
to CSUMB.<br></li>
<li>We launched our annual fund with a gift of $40,000 from the
First National Bank of Central California for
scholarships.<br></li>
<li>Forty community members and campus leaders formed the
President&apos;s Task Force-precursor to our current President&apos;s
Council.<br></li>
<li>Faculty members and students joined me to talk about CSUMB at
21 town hall meetings, connecting us with community
leaders.<br></li>
<li>The Fort Ord Alumni Association awarded its first five $1,000
scholarships.<br></li>
<li>And our service learning program continued to expand to become
a national model, partnering with over 250 agencies and schools to
deliver more than 22 thousand hours of service to our
communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list creates an impressive picture of the community
providing for CSUMB, and CSUMB providing for the community in a
wonderful, dynamic partnership.</p>
<h6>1999-2000-The Year of Technology</h6>
<p>Technology has been a big part of CSUMB from the start. We&apos;ve
always been networked for the 21st century-whether wired or
wireless-and equipped to use and teach a range of proven technology
tools. Academically, technology has allowed us to defy the
traditional limits of time and space through online instruction,
electronic exchange of assignments, and email communication between
professors and students. Your overloaded in-boxes may serve as the
best testament to the way that technology has changed the way we
teach, learn, and do business. During 1999-2000:</p>
<ul>
<li>We helped launch CalStateTEACH as a break-the-mold online
credential program.<br></li>
<li>Students began to stream live radio via the
internet.<br></li>
<li>And we made an intentional push to leverage email and our
website to improve communication from the campus leadership to make
our planning, processes, and decisions more transparent and
responsive to all of you.</li>
</ul>
<h6>2000-2001-The Year of Campus Activities</h6>
<p>During the early years, residential students told us that there
was not enough to do on campus. By 2000-2001, that had clearly
begun to change. The list of campus events that year was long,
addressing diverse interests. Here&apos;s just a snippet: Kelp Kraze;
D&#xED;a De Los Muertos; visiting artists like Gustavo Leclerc and
Daniel Glover; the Monterey Bay Film Fest 2000; the digital divide
panel discussion; astronaut Sally Ride; International Women&apos;s Day
with keynote speaker Dr. June Jordan; a full slate of home events
in nine intercollegiate sports; and an amazing list of outdoor
recreation offerings. These almost-daily events coupled with the
finalization of plans for a performing arts program, make 2000-2001
the Year of Campus Activity</p>
<h6>2001-2002-The Year of Planning</h6>
<p>After 18 months of hard work under the direction of Provost
Diane Cordero de Noriega, the Strategic Plan was finalized and put
into action in January 2002. It has served us extremely well,
particularly in our preparations for accreditation. And it has
helped us to maintain our focus on our Vision and mission, to
prioritize through tough budget times, and to align all of our
other planning efforts. Most importantly, it has provided focus for
our accountability.</p>
<h6>2002-2003-The Year of Accreditation</h6>
<p>If 2001-2002 was the year of planning, accreditation was the
story the following year. The Strategic Plan and a bevy of other
documents ultimately served as the evidence that helped us earn
accreditation at the end of the 2002-2003 academic year. I will
never forget the standing ovation that the Western Association of
Schools and Colleges team gave us as they shared their findings,
including these words in their report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is our view that CSUMB is a product of scholarship at its
best-rigorous, ethical, socially responsible, and respectful of the
values and strengths of a diverse group of people who have adopted
a common vision and sense of purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<h6>2003-2004-The Year of the Donor</h6>
<p>Though we have benefited throughout our short history from the
generosity of many, it will be tough to top the gifts that we
received in 2003-2004. First, Patricia and Robert Chapman donated
$2.5 million to the Science Academic Center. Shortly after, the
Tanimura and Antle families committed $4 million to our new
library. The generosity of these community members, symbolizing the
generosity, the insight, and the leadership of so many members of
our surrounding communities, will forever mark &apos;03-&apos;04 in my mind
as the Year of the Donor.</p>
<h6>2004-2005-The Year of the Building</h6>
<p>And this year, the Year of the Building, we brought the new
North Quad Housing online in record time. This spring, we will also
cut the ribbon on the new Alumni &amp; Visitor Center and break
ground for the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Master Plan Update, recently approved by the
Board of Trustees at their November meeting, gives strong direction
to the continued physical growth of the campus. It embraces
environmentally sound planning practices, focuses on completing the
physical transformation of the former army base, and provides easy
and inviting campus access to members of our local communities. I&apos;m
sure they&apos;ll believe it when they see it!</p>
<p>The plan revolves around the creation of a heart-of-green, a
large open space that will be built as part of the infrastructure
project and the Tanimura &amp; Antle Library project. And it
incorporates the development of the new faculty/staff housing
project to the west of the new North Quad student housing.</p>
<p>All of the building and master planning activity will make me
remember &apos;04-&apos;05 as the Year of the Building.</p>
<h5>CSUMB Today</h5>
<p>Over 10 years, these powerful forces-Vision, faculty, students,
staff, community, technology, campus activities, planning,
accreditation, donors, and building-have fused to produce the CSUMB
of today-a Vision-focused, mission-driven model of learning access
and excellence for California and America.</p>
<p>Every one of us should be proud of the ten-year process that has
created this university, our individual roles in it, and the
amazing products of that process-our graduates who now positively
influence virtually every walk of community life.</p>
<p>We should be particularly proud of our persistence through the
recent recession. We have endured a series of cuts, funding shifts,
student fee increases, reallocations, salary freezes, and more,
while cutting approximately $6.7 million from our budget, almost 15
percent.</p>
<p>We have reorganized and we have worked smarter with one
people-oriented goal in mind: to keep serving our students,
sustaining the mission of the university without laying anybody
off. And we have succeeded!</p>
<p>Ten years ago, we started in the same boat, we have stayed in
the same boat to weather all the storms, and we have made it to the
other side in the same boat.</p>
<h6>The Compact &amp; Revitalization</h6>
<p>So where are we right now? With the Compact reached last spring
between the Board of Trustees and the governor to stabilize funding
for the CSU over the next six years, it looks as though we will be
able to slowly grow again. To ensure thoughtfulness-with input from
the Academic Senate, the four administrative divisions, and the
Foundation-the Cabinet and I are developing a revitalization plan.
My instructions to the Cabinet members have been to imagine how
they would like their divisions to be positioned six years from now
to provide effective and efficient service. I&apos;ve asked them to not
think in terms of recapturing what they have lost and reinstating
what they had as an organizational structure in 2001 when the
decline began. Instead, I have asked them to use this process to
reposition people and services for higher effectiveness and higher
quality based on what we have learned since 2001.</p>
<p>If we communicate well and work together, this revitalization
effort will restore our growth and momentum, not only as a
university community committed to providing improved educational
opportunities to its students and surrounding communities, but also
as a beacon for badly needed innovation and change in American
higher education.</p>
<p>The compact represents a baseline of stability for the CSU and
for CSU Monterey Bay. Given still-limited state resources, you
could say, and I would agree, that it includes something for
everyone to hate. On the other hand, it is very positive in that it
allows us to plan for the future instead of reacting month by month
to an ever-changing set of circumstances. Because of its central
importance to our politics, our budgets, and our future stability,
I will take a few minutes to describe the Compact&apos;s provisions to
you.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first Compact category-enrollment increases-identifies a
2.5 percent climb in CSU systemwide enrollment each year until the
end of the Compact in 2011. CSUMB joined other CSUs with smaller
enrollments to propose that the Chancellor&apos;s Office establish a
tiered approach to enrollment growth, through which the smaller
CSUs would receive higher targets to offset the negative impact of
smaller scale and smaller base budgets. I am pleased to tell you
today that the Chancellor&apos;s Office has approved this tiered
approach, so the estimates on the projected Enrollment Growth chart
reflect 5 percent annual growth starting in 2006-07. This next
chart graphically presents the translation of this enrollment
growth into annual budget increases. It also shows the budget
increases associated with the other Compact categories.<br>
</li>
<li>The second Compact category is tuition and fee increases. This
is a tough one, and many of us will work to change this. It allows
resident undergraduate fees to rise no more than 10 percent per
year. The rate of increase in nonresident and graduate/credential
fees and out-of-state tuition rates are somewhat higher.<br></li>
<li>The third Compact category-basic budget support-identifies a
three-percent increase per year in state General Fund support. As
with enrollment growth, we are presenting a case, along with
several other smaller CSUs, that we need a more sensitive
distribution of the fiscal impact of programs such as Year-Round
Operations and the Common Management System that have a systemwide
impact and standard fixed costs. They hit disproportionately
heavily on smaller campuses. With a significantly smaller budget
base, fixed-cost programs take money away from badly needed student
services. Not knowing what relief might be provided, the total for
this category includes only the confirmed systemwide baseline
growth.<br></li>
<li>The fourth and final Compact category-Core Academic Support
Needs-provides an additional one-percent growth in state General
Fund support in the last three years of the Compact for basic
infrastructure, equipment, and library improvements.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, for CSUMB, the total increase in funding from
these four categories over the six years of the Compact is
currently estimated at being slightly over $26 million. That&apos;s a
lot of money.</p>

<p>As we look at the accumulated amounts, we are already estimating
the obligations that we will have to expense against them.
Importantly, long-awaited salary increases have been built into the
Compact as an immediate priority, with the current compensation
pool increase for fiscal year 2005-2006 somewhere in the
neighborhood of 3.5 percent. You can see from the charts that,
after these expenses are deducted, there will be money for growth,
but not as much as any of us would like. There&apos;s nowhere near
enough in any single year for everyone to get everything they need.
So, the value of our revitalization effort is that we will think
about our future together and set our priorities over time so that
each division and department will know when their priorities are
coming up for consideration.</p>
<h6>Other Tools for Revitalization</h6>
<p>Budget improvement is not, however, the only tool we have for
revitalization. We have much more to build from.</p>
<p><em>Academic Program Growth</em></p>
<p>CSUMB&apos;s academic model is the boldest in American higher
education, putting learning and the learner first and holding
quality assurance through learning outcomes high for all to
see.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the budget rebound, new academic programs have
been forwarded to the Chancellor&apos;s Office for review and approval.
These programs represent the continuing hard work of the faculty to
be responsive to the needs of our community. Two of these
programs-an Executive Master&apos;s in Business Administration and a
Master&apos;s in Instructional Science and Technology-will be launched
through Extended Education on a self-support basis. Another
proposed graduate program-the Master of Science in Coastal and
Watershed Policy-will build a community of professionals who can
employ sound science, technology, and economics to inform public
policy.</p>
<p>Other programs granted authorization to plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bachelor of science in computer science and information
technology with concentrations in software engineering, networking,
and security and game development<br></li>
<li>Nursing<br></li>
<li>A bachelor of arts in kinesiology<br></li>
<li>A major in human development<br></li>
<li>Biological sciences<br></li>
<li>And a master of arts in teaching through CalStateTEACH</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Strategic Plan</em></p>
<p>Beyond our academic model, we have the Strategic Plan and its
related assessments to build on. We are one of a handful of
institutions that collect data regularly-from the National Survey
of Student Engagement, the Collegiate Learning Assessment program,
our own evaluations, and other national data sources-to assess our
ability to serve students effectively. Just as we hold students
accountable for learning outcomes, through strategic planning we
hold ourselves accountable for increasing our effectiveness in
serving learners successfully.</p>
<p>So, friends and colleagues, CSUMB has weathered the challenges
of the last few years because we are a strong community and an
amazing place of learning. We are intact and we have preserved our
essence. I&apos;m very proud of our success. Each of you should be,
too.</p>
<h5>The Future</h5>
<p>Now, with the budget improving, academic programs expanding, and
our strategic planning succeeding, the next few years should be a
time for optimism and steady growth.</p>
<p>When I initially drafted this speech, I expected to be here, a
member of the CSUMB community for several years to come. The UNESCO
opportunity has changed all of that. Nevertheless, I have created,
with the Cabinet, some ideas for our second decade of development,
and I can&apos;t close today without at least putting them on the table
for you to think about.</p>
<p>We believe that it will not be enough to just grow again. As its
second decade starts, CSUMB must strive to further realize the
opportunity we have given ourselves to be a great university, to
become a model of higher education access and excellence. Here then
are some final wishes-a vision of what might take place here before
I return to be just a face in the crowd at the Panetta Institute in
2010.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our operating structure and organizational habits must deepen
support of the Vision and the operations that we value so much.
Caring and believing passionately are only the preconditions to
lasting organizational change and innovation. Discipline and
commitment to improve, every day and every year, lie at the heart
of greatness.<br></li>
<li>We need to build deeper intentionality and accountability into
everything we do. We ask students to tell us what they know and can
do as a result of their learning, to be accountable for outcomes.
We need to continue to hold ourselves to the same
standard.<br></li>
<li>We need to develop programs intentionally with an eye to
community needs, driven by data and drawn toward
quality.<br></li>
<li>We need to strengthen our enrollment management with a specific
emphasis on retention and persistence to the degree, including
initiatives to improve the articulation of community college
coursework with our degree requirements and to conduct degree
audits guaranteeing that students can graduate with 120
credits.<br></li>
<li>We need to increase the quality of the faculty experience at
CSUMB by securing more faculty grants to extend our work, by
developing on-campus faculty recognition to parallel the CSU Wang
awards, and by fairly managing our workloads.<br></li>
<li>We need to improve the quality of life for students, creating a
diverse set of opportunities that give every student a home on this
campus. We can do this by securing gifts that support our Vision
and mission; by expanding clubs and the Greek system; by offering
more in the visual and performing arts; and by expanding all
aspects of our recreation programs including NCAA Division II
athletics, intramurals, outdoor recreation, and club sports. We
should support these very differing initiatives, understanding that
the mark of a truly comprehensive university is not the projection
of one worldview. Rather, it is the fostering and support of all of
the diverse worldviews, allowing them to rub up against each other
and, yes, sometimes create a little controversy, that creates the
rich climate of a multicultural, multidimensional learning
community.<br></li>
<li>We need to develop our outcomes-based educational model by
financially supporting the differential costs that make it unique,
keeping our class sizes reasonable so faculty can teach and
students can learn, developing technology as an embedded feature,
and solidifying the Capstone expe</li></ul></div></div></div>
