<p>On April 28, CSUMB&apos;s black-tie dinner event, the Seventh Annual
Celebration of Community, is held at the University Center.
Paradise Catering provides the spectacular cuisine, but the
highlight of the evening is the introduction of the people who have
made significant contributions to their professions and their
communities.</p>
<p>This year&apos;s group of Fellows join members of the community-and
honorees from years past-in this much-anticipated annual affair.
The event&apos;s proceeds benefit CSUMB&apos;s Local Area Scholarship
Opportunity Program, which provides scholarships to students at
each public high school and community college in the Tri-County
area. This year&apos;s honorees are:</p>

<p>NOTE: Luis Valdez is CSUMB&apos;s most famous faculty member and an
integral part of the university&apos;s founding group. Valdez, an
inspiring figure and public speaker, is credited by many faculty
members as having been the focal point for community-building among
faculty member in the university&apos;s earliest days. He&apos;s a
playwright, activist, screenwriter, filmmaker, and college
professor (currently on indefinite leave). Valdez gathered striking
farmworkers in the 1960s; founded the nationally-known El Teatro
Campesino (started on a flatbed truck that went into the fields to
perform for workers); wrote the hit play <em>Zoot Suit</em> (which
made it to Broadway before becoming a motion picture starring
Edward James Olmos in 1978); and wrote and directed the hit movie
<em>La Bamba</em> (1987). By joining CSUMB in 1995, Valdez accepted
his first teaching position in almost 20 years.</p>
