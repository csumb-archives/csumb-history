<h5>Carolyn Drouin</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: Originally from Lodi, Carolyn Drouin
first visited Fort Ord long before CSUMB existed: &quot;My Dad was a
Marine,&quot; she says, &quot;and we stayed in the housing here when I was in
sixth grade. We visited because my Dad races cars at Laguna Seca. I
just really liked the area. My parents are both teachers, and I
knew I wanted to go to a school near the ocean. In the spring of
1998 I came out on a weekend to check out the campus. I remember we
parked near the Library and nobody was here because there&apos;s nothing
to do here on the weekend. We saw all these deserted buildings . .
. I had already [been accepted] to come here. I thought I was
stuck.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember telling people when I got here that my main goal was
to get out of CSUMB; I was going to transfer to Cal-Poly [San Luis
Obispo]. But I got hooked: the relationships with all the people I
met, and in HCOM [Human Communication], you get to know your
professors. For students there are so many opportunities to get
involved, and I got involved.&quot; Drouin graduated from CSUMB with a
degree in Human Communication in 2003. At CSUMB, Drouin&apos;s
activities and accomplishments included:</p>
<ul>
<li>President&apos;s Award winner in 2003</li>
<li>President of Women&apos;s Rugby Club, later becoming captain and
coach</li>
<li>Multicultural Club for 1 1/2 years, helping organize the first
Winter Semi-Formal</li>
<li>Orientation Leader for 2 years</li>
<li>Judicial Director for Student Voice</li>
<li>Statewide Affairs Rep for Student Voice</li>
<li>Cal State Student Association Lobby Core Officer</li>
<li>Alumni Board member</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: Still living on campus (&quot;I moved four
blocks after graduation&quot;), Drouin is the Resources Coordinator for
Abel Maldonado, who was elected to the California State Senate in
2004. Drouin is working in Salinas with the consulting company in
charge of the Maldonado campaign, serving multiple roles, including
fundraising. &quot;I do anything and everything,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;CSUMB really touts its class sizes. I remember my Tech Tools
class was the biggest class I was in. There were 60 people. People
[at other schools] don&apos;t get to know their classmates or teachers.
They go to school, they leave, and they don&apos;t get involved. Because
of a high percentage of people living on campus [at CSUMB], you
can&apos;t <em>not</em> know what&apos;s going on here.</p>
<p>&quot;Otter Days was an awesome experience. I&apos;m friends to this day
with all but two [of the seven] people from my group. I got to know
a lot of cool people, and the camping experience was a lot of
fun.&quot;</p>
