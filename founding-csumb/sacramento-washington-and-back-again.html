<p>From December 1992 to January 1993, Hank Hendrickson and Handel
Evans make numerous trips between Sacramento, Washington D.C., and
Long Beach (the Headquarters of California State University) to
secure approvals and the necessary planning funding to move forward
with campus development.</p>
<p>In Washington, they shuttle back and forth between the offices
of the Department of Defense, the Army, the Department of
Education, and the Washington offices of local government
officials.</p>
<p>The news is not good. Both the Department of Defense and the
Army have said no to the idea of gifting part of the valuable Fort
Ord land to the university. Some officials that Hendrickson and
Evans have spoken with are in fact adamantly opposed to the idea.
While the top leadership of the Department of Defense has decreed
that the bases be closed, there have been no instructions to
lower-level authorities to hand the property over to civilian
organizations.</p>
<p>Hank Hendrickson credits Congressman Norman Mineta for saving
the day.</p>
<p>Mineta, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives
representing the heart of California&apos;s Silicon Valley, and Chairman
of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, grew up in
San Jose, and was once the Mayor of that city. As a member of
Congress, Mineta is known for his dedication to the people of his
district, for consensus building among his colleagues, and for
forging public-private partnerships. Hendrickson and Evans stop by
Mineta&apos;s office on a courtesy call before flying back to
California, their mission a failure.</p>
<p>&quot;It was our last stop before leaving Washington. Everyone had
said no, to both the land and the money,&quot; recounts Hendrickson. It
was at the end of the day, and Congressman Mineta was about to
leave for home, where he had dinner guests waiting. Mineta asked
Evans and Hendrickson about the progress of the project. When
Mineta heard their discouraging reports, he immediately picked up
the phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Mineta first called William Perry, [then Deputy Secretary of
Defense]. Then he called Jack Murtha [U.S. Representative for
Pennsylvania, and then Chairman of the Defense Appropriations
Subcommittee]. Next, he called Ron Dellums [U.S. Representative for
California and then Chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee]. He spoke to each several times. His wife kept calling,
asking him to come home and tend to his dinner guests. But he
wouldn&apos;t go home until he had an answer.</p>
<p>&quot;When we left Mineta&apos;s office, we had the land and the
money.&quot;</p>
