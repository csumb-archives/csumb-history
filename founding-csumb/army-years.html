<p>For over 75 years prior to the founding of CSUMB, the ground on
which the campus now stands was known as an army base to hundreds
of families and local community members. As the largest American
military post outside the South, Fort Ord attracted scores of
minority and interracial families. An African-American city
councilwoman from Seaside describes Fort Ord fondly as &quot;a post of
compassion for minorities and for children with disabilities. It
was an employer and it provided many starts.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. Army conducted a multitude of operations over Fort
Ord&apos;s existence. This is a very brief synopsis of those years:</p>
<p><strong>1917</strong> Land was purchased just north of the city
of Monterey for use as an artillery-training field for the army.
The area was variously known as Gigling Reservations, U.S. Field
Artillery Area-Presidio of Monterey, and Gigling Field Artillery
Range.</p>
<p><strong>1933</strong> The artillery field became Camp Ord.
Primarily, horse cavalry units trained on the camp until the
military began to mechanize and train mobile combat units</p>
<p><strong>1941</strong> Camp Ord became Fort Ord. For the next
thirty years, the fort became the primary facility for basic
training for the Army. At 28,000 acres-approximately 44 square
miles-the fort was larger than the county of San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>1976</strong> Fort Ord ceased activity as the nation&apos;s
primary basic training site. Approximately 1.5 million men and
women-including such luminaries as Clark Gable, Clint Eastwood, and
Jerry Garcia-had received their basic training at Fort Ord. At its
peak, more than 35,000 people lived and worked on the base.</p>
<p><strong>1988</strong> Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
legislation was passed by Congress.</p>
<p><strong>1990</strong> Fort Ord was declared a Superfund site,
requiring cleanup of all contaminated areas.</p>
<p><strong>1991</strong> The decision to close Fort Ord was made.
Of the hundreds of bases targeted for closure across the country,
Fort Ord was one of four selected by the Federal Government to be a
model for conversion to peacetime use.</p>
<p><strong>1994</strong> Fort Ord officially closed. The fort was
the largest U.S. military base to be closed at the time.</p>
