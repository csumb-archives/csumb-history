<h5>Matt Dudich</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: Matt Dudich is a 2001 CSUMB graduate in
Management and International Entrepreneurship (IMIE, now called
Business). Originally from a small town outside Sacramento, he
chose CSUMB because it was the only school he could find that had a
program specific to entrepreneurship. While visiting the campus
before deciding to enroll in 1996, he found that he liked the area
and the pleasant weather: &quot;I thought it would be a great place to
live for a few years.&quot; While at CSUMB, Dudich&apos;s activities and
accomplishments included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Founding Rugby team member, playing for three years</li>
<li>Coaching women&apos;s Rugby for two years</li>
<li>Several Service Learning Projects, including working for a
division of the Salvation Army, helping homeless people to create
resumes and cover letters, and get training to find a job</li>
</ul>
<p>Dudich says: &quot;The first thing is that CSUMB was advantageous in
that I learned skills out in the world-unlike people who came out
of places like Harvard. Our classes were based on real practical
applications; we <em>really</em> did things. We would write things
like business plans and have to pitch them out in the world. That
really gave me a leg up.</p>
<p>&quot;The second thing was class size. Some of my business classes
had only ten or twelve people in them, so the instructor could
spend extra time. It wasn&apos;t a big lecture hall with a teacher&apos;s aid
meeting with students. It was cutting edge as well. Progressive. In
one class we had to create business plans and web sites, and pitch
them to people in Silicon Valley. And we had to do all of that in
one semester.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: Matt Dudich is now working in finance in
Chicago for HSBC, the second largest bank in the world, with 100
million customers in 80 countries. Dudich has been with HSBC for
five years, working the past several months in the Corporate Credit
Risk Department. &quot;I started as an intern at CSUMB before I
graduated. Dr. [Sandy] Hale recommended me to Household [part of
HSBC] in Salinas. Eventually I started working there as a Financial
Analyst.&quot;</p>
<p>Dudich recalls with fondness CSUMB&apos;s very first rugby game,
against Stanford University&apos;s rookie team in 1996: &quot;There were
growing pains all over the place at CSUMB. Here we were playing
Stanford, an established team (and university). In rugby, you host
the other school: have a barbecue, welcome them in. And we didn&apos;t
even have a <em>field</em>. We just had a super-dry patch of weeds,
north of campus. There were dried thorns in the ground, potholes
you could literally fall into, no bleachers, no goalposts, no
markers.</p>
<p>&quot;We went the night before and cleaned it up, put up posts, the
chalk, everything. The next day we beat them-a very prominent
school. It was like everything else at CSUMB: you stepped up and
made do, and made it a great experience. That was our inaugural
game.&quot;</p>
<h5>Joseph Lara</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: Joseph Lara graduated from CSUMB in 2001
with a degree in Social and Behavioral Science (SBSC). While at
CSUMB, Lara&apos;s activities and accomplishments included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing rugby for three years and soccer for two</li>
<li>Studying abroad for one academic year (1999-2000) at Kingston
University in London</li>
<li>Volunteering with the Panetta Institute</li>
<li>Community service reading tutor</li>
</ul>
<p>Lara cites as helpful influences Social and Behavioral Science
professors, Drs. Gerald Schenk, Raymond Gonzales, and Sandra
Pacheco: &quot;I didn&apos;t know what I wanted to do when I got [to CSUMB].
They were very confident in their program, and I knew that they
were going to help me graduate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What I remember when I got there [in fall 1997] is that there
wasn&apos;t much there. There was literally nothing to do, so we started
forming sports teams, getting athletics elevated, clubs, etc. I
remember that everything seemed to get started that year
[1997].&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: Lara has applied to law school and is
awaiting word for admission to either Western State University
College of Law or Chapman College-both in southern California.</p>
<p>Lara says: &quot;CSUMB was a great place; it was new. What was great
about it was you could have a social life and an educational life.
There were lots of beach parties, and a great sense of community
[on campus]. &quot;I&apos;d tell the students today that college life is what
you make it. I had a great time, and found a lot to do.&quot;</p>
<h5>Grace Mendez</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: Grace Mendez graduated from CSUMB in 2001
with a degree in Social and Behavioral Science (SBSC). Having
transferred from Fresno State, Grace&apos;s initial reaction to the
barren CSUMB campus and its newfangled &quot;outcomes-based&quot; education
rhetoric was mixed: &quot;It was a little shocking,&quot; she remembers. &quot;At
Fresno, which is a pretty traditional school, we were given
lectures, then tested; it was pretty repetitive. Coming to CSUMB, I
was really impressed with the faculty; they were knowledgeable and
obvious experts in their fields. But showing competency through
outcomes-based [means], like portfolios and projects, rather than
solely testing . . . That was unconventional. But the campus being
pretty barren and the other challenges, it didn&apos;t detract from our
learning at all. Or the teaching of the faculty. Now, as a staff
person [in Financial Aid], it&apos;s great to see students come through
and facilitate the process.&quot; Mendez&apos;s activities and
accomplishments at CSUMB included:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the original Pioneer students, having enrolled in
August, 1995</li>
<li>Student assistant in CSUMB&apos;s Financial Aid office in 1995</li>
<li>Hired by Financial Aid as an assistant in 1998</li>
<li>Became Financial Aid counselor in 2000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now:</strong> Grace Mendez is now a financial Aid
counselor (Grade II) at CSUMB and a mother of two young daughters,
Grace would like to go to graduate school, possibly taking up
studies in anthropology, with an emphasis on social work.</p>
<h5>Nile Duppstadt II</h5>
<p><strong>Then:</strong> A 2001 graduate with a Management and
International Entrepreneurship degree (IMIE) cum laude, Nile
Duppstadt contributed substantially to strengthening the CSUMB
infrastructure. He was a Student Voice senator during a critical
time at CSUMB, and he played a leadership role on a number of key
task forces and committees. He also collaborated on the development
of the definition by Student Voice of &quot;multiculturalism.&quot;</p>
<p>Duppstadt played a major role in providing input to the Western
Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) accreditation process,
and was the Student Voice liaison to WASC. Nile also worked as an
advocate for students as a liaison to the former Provost on a
regular basis, and served on the hiring committee of our current
Provost. In addition, his work with the Academic Skills Achievement
Program, in which he developed workshops for English as Second
Language and limited English Proficiency students, exemplifies
putting the CSUMB Vision to work. While managing all of these
activities, he also made substantial contributions to the IMIE
major as website developer.</p>
<p>Says Duppstadt: &quot;I am truly honored. Being recognized in such a
way means I made a difference in this community. It has
strengthened my belief that if you try hard, keep your focus, and
continually help others when possible, those efforts will not go
unnoticed.&quot;</p>
<p>Duppstadt&apos;s plan right after graduation? &quot;Stepping out of my
realm by going to South-East Asia for two months. I have been going
to school my entire life-I&apos;m going to take a long-overdue break!
