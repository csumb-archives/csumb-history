<p>On May 25, the top awards for graduating seniors are presented
by CSUMB President Peter Smith in the University Center Ballroom at
Senior Awards Night. One student, Merlyn Calderon, becomes the
first CSUMB student to win two awards.</p>
<p>The Outstanding Senior awards are given out based on an
application process and committee decision. Students can apply to
or be nominated for the specific award. Each application contains
different criteria for winning the award. The winners are:</p>
<h5>President&apos;s Award for Exemplary Student Achievement: Nile
Duppstadt II</h5>
<p>Duppstadt, a 22-year-old Institute for Management and
International Entrepreneurship (IMIE&amp;#8212known on most
campuses as Business) major from Burlington, Vermont, maintained an
overall cumulative grade point average of 3.74 while doing pioneer
work as an English as a Second Language tutor; was co-captain of
the inaugural soccer team; was a Student Voice Senator (student
government); and was member of the first Strategic Planning
Committee. The winner of this award is the student speaker at
commencement.</p>
<h5>Provost&apos;s Award for Exemplary Academic Achievement: Sabrina
Graziano</h5>
<p>Graziano, a student from Rome, Italy who has lived in the
Monterey area for seven years, has an impressive list of
accomplishments. She successfully balanced a remarkable academic
load while facing the challenges of managing multiple roles as
student, mother, and immigrant with English as a second language.
She transferred to CSUMB from Monterey Peninsula College in the
fall of 1998 and completed all her University Learning Requirements
and Major Learning Outcomes in just five semesters, finishing with
the highest grade point average in Institute for Management and
International Entrepreneurship (IMIE).</p>
<h5>Outstanding Senior Award for Tri-County Achievement: Merlyn
Calderon</h5>
<p>Merlyn Calderon, a Global Studies major from Salinas, has an
extraordinary record of community involvement and achievement,
including community volunteer service with Natividad Medical
Center, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, Monterey County AIDS Project,
and various other community agencies and institutions. She is the
co-founder of &quot;Mothers of Chualar,&quot; an organization which brings
about positive change and community empowerment. Calderon has also
served as a positive role model on campus through her involvement
with Student Voice, Educational Talent Search, and other
educational outreach activities.</p>
<p>&quot;I am fighting a battle,&quot; Calderon explains. &quot;The battle of
changing minds and myths behind college in underrepresented
communities. I will carry the CSUMB Vision Statement as a Vision of
life in whatever I do and wherever I may be.&quot;</p>
<h5>Outstanding Senior Award for Social Justice: Ethan Brown</h5>
<p>Brown, a 21-year-old Integrated Special Studies major of
Progressive Political Action from Redlands, California, has
demonstrated a commitment to social justice, both in theory and in
practice, within the campus community and the local community. He
has provided perspective on the issue of multiculturalism,
challenged others to embrace the CSUMB Vision, and has persisted in
his efforts to demonstrate how multiculturalism at CSUMB must
include the recognition of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender
people, and those struggling with sexual identity. His role as an
advocate for the underrepresented is best exemplified by his
involvement as the Multicultural Senator for Student Voice, where
he worked to promote numerous issues affecting women, the disabled,
CSUMB employees, ethnic diversity, and the &quot;No on 22&quot; Campaign,
which sought to deny domestic partnership rights to same-sex
couples. In addition, Ethan has provided leadership on several
campus committees and task forces, always promoting a multicultural
perspective.</p>
<p>&quot;CSU Monterey Bay gave me the opportunity to grow as a leader
and to flourish as an activist,&quot; Brown explains. &quot;After graduation,
I plan to continue my work towards social justice, both in my
personal and professional life. I am honored to be recognized for
my Queer Activism on campus and in the community.&quot;</p>
<h5>Alumni Vision Award: Merlyn Calderon</h5>
<p>The Alumni Vision Award goes to Merlyn Calderon (her second
Senior Award) in recognition of her achievements while a student at
CSUMB and the leadership she provided that extended the CSUMB
Vision into the lives of others. Her service to the</p></div></div></div>
