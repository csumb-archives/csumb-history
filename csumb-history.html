<p>From bayonets to baccalaureates, from barracks to books, from
swords to plowshares, from arming soldiers for war to arming
students for the workplace . . .</p>
<p>No matter how you look at the transformation, CSUMB has a rich
and interesting history.</p>
<p>That history has been summarized here in a year-by-year review
that includes major events, significant milestones, and notable
achievements as recollected by faculty, staff, students, and
administrators. The history through 1992 was written by Lori Wood
in 2004 for the celebration of CSUMB&apos;s tenth anniversary. Material
from 1993 through academic year 2003-2004 was written by George
Joyce and edited by Lori Wood, also during 2004. These authors drew
historical material from a number of sources that sometimes
contradicted each other. Please bring any inaccuracies to our
attention.</p>
<p>Something missing? If you remember something major that we
haven&apos;t covered, please <a href="http://csumb.edu/anniversary/story-submission/index.html" rel="nofollow">submit</a> it. Even if you remember something minor that
you think others would find interesting, submit that. We won&apos;t post
everything here, but we&apos;ll put everything somewhere, so please
share.</p>
