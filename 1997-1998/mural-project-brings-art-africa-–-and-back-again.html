<p>Victoria Shaw is a professional photographer in Seattle; her
mission in life is to develop something that kids all over the
world can share and enjoy together. The result is the Mural
Project, a traveling piece of art drawn solely for and by kids.</p>
<p>Kim Woods is a CSUMB student and member of the board of
directors of The Mural Project, who volunteers as part of her
studies in art and science. Woods became involved with the Mural
Project because of CSUMB&apos;s requirements that each student
participate in a service-learning class. Woods decided to do her
service in Tanzania, East Africa, where she taught English to
children. She met Shaw, the project director, in Arusha-the town in
which she had lived while teaching the previous summer. Shaw was
doing her second mural with local school children, and Woods
decided to help with the mural in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Once the paper is laid out and the crayons dispensed, the kids
take over-the only directions are to draw their favorite animal.
Thereafter, pieces of the mural travel with Shaw and her volunteers
from one destination to the next. One piece of a mural done by kids
in Tanzania is shown to kids in Seattle. There are three
installations of the mural completed by 1997. The first is at
Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, the second in Arusha, Tanzania, and
the latest in Chimicum, Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;What&apos;s amazing to me,&quot; explains Woods, &quot;was how each culture
affected the individual drawings. The kids in Chimicum had all
these beautiful cheetahs, elephants, lions, giraffes, and monkeys
while my students in Tanzania drew dogs and rats, cows and hens. It
was startling to realize that the kids who lived literally next
door to the African savanna had never seen it.&quot;</p>
<p>The mural eventually travels back to Africa, with destinations
including Rwanda, Namibia, and Zambia. Later travels include India,
Europe, and South America.</p>
<p>Once back and settled into CSUMB campus life, Woods continues
working in fields that pertain to her integrated studies of science
and public art. She feels that being on the board of directors for
the Mural Project and working with Victoria Shaw is one way to
further her studies.</p>
<p>&quot;I learned so much in helping with this project. It combines the
major things I care about, children, animals, and art, and enables
me to share what I love with others,&quot; says Woods.</p>
