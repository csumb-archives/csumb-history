<h5>Stephanie Smith</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: Stephanie Smith, originally from
Huntington Beach, was a member of CSUMB&apos;s &quot;Pioneer&quot; Class of 1999.
She received a B.A. in Human Communication (HCOM). As an
upper-division student, Smith became a student assistant in Student
Activities and after graduation became the interim student
activities coordinator for a year. Smith&apos;s other accomplishments
and activities while at CSUMB included:</p>
<ul>
<li>International Women&apos;s Day Award Winner for outstanding women
and their community contributions</li>
<li>Started the first photography club, taking many of the first
pictures that made it into the school publications</li>
<li>Helped organize the first Monte Carlo Night, which raised money
for the Red Cross and local flood victims (believed to be the first
student-run major event)</li>
<li>Part of the first Service Learning courses connected to dance
and teaching at many of the local schools</li>
<li>Involved in various leadership conferences and workshops,
including Job Fairs, Whole Body/Mind Fairs, and awareness
activities (e.g., sexual assault)</li>
<li>Part of the Multicultural Club, including leading many of the
Multicultural Comedy Nights, and serving one year as
coordinator</li>
<li>Part of the Interclub Council from the beginning, helping to
coordinate funding for the student groups on campus</li>
<li>Founding member of the CSUMB Dance Team</li>
</ul>
<p>Smith says: &quot;We [dance team members] had a great time. We didn&apos;t
have uniforms so we bought matching outfits. I remember the first
performance was at halftime of a basketball game. We purposely
tried to be dancers and not cheerleaders. It was a great experience
from the beginning and watching it grow. I was never part of [a
dance team] from the get-go.&quot;</p>
<p>About her experiences in the early day of CSUMB: &quot;I thought it
would be good to be part of something new and heard that [CSUMB
was] going to approach education in a new way. My impression of the
school when I first got there sticks out in my mind: the boarded-up
windows and abandoned buildings. And in the middle of it all were
these brightly colored buildings. I wondered if I&apos;d made the right
choice. It seemed like an abandoned ghost town to outsiders.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, I learned a lot in many different ways. I was prepared
for the &apos;real world&apos; more because it wasn&apos;t a typical education.
You had to take an active role in your education. Things were
always changing, but I was able to take on a leadership role, and I
had never really done that before. CSUMB gave me the opportunity to
see myself in new ways.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: Living in Seattle, Stephanie Smith is now
a graduate student at the University of Washington, getting her
M.A. in Education with a multicultural education emphasis. She&apos;s
also an intern for the Institute for Community Leadership, a
nonprofit that focuses on empowering youth to work toward social
justice.</p>
<p>Smith says: &quot;Because I took advantage of so many opportunities,
I never felt disconnected. I got involved in so many things. The
professors were really approachable and cared about looking at
things in new ways, and they helped shape what I&apos;m doing now in my
career. I didn&apos;t really appreciate it until now, when I see what
other people got in their education. I appreciate [my education]
more now than I did then.&quot;</p>
<h5>Yolanda Gutierrez</h5>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: A native of Salinas, Yolanda Gutierrez
transferred to CSUMB in her junior year. Within two years (in May
1998), she graduated with a degree in Human Communication (HCOM).
In her senior year, Gutierrez&apos;s Senior Capstone project was an
award winner: &quot;Prisoners without Trial: The Evacuation Experience
of the Local Japanese-American Community following the Bombing of
Pearl Harbor&quot; includes more than 100 images, archival footage, oral
histories, news clippings, government documents, and music, all
incorporated into a 35-minute video. The honors for the video
included: First Place among entrants from the 21 CSU campuses in
the California State University Research Competition&apos;s Humanities
and Letters Division; TV interviews; and invitations to speak to
local schools, and, perhaps most importantly, to members of the
local Japanese-American community. Among Gutierrez&apos; accomplishments
and activities while at CSUMB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writer for the school newspaper, <em>Otter Realm</em>, which
started in 1996</li>
<li>Selected for Leon Panetta&apos;s first Government and Governing
class</li>
<li>Very involved with the Japanese-American community-including
service commitments that aided in her research for her
award-winning Capstone project (see 1997-1998)</li>
</ul>
<p>Gutierrez says: &quot;Once I got to CSUMB and started talking to
people, HCOM sounded like they were doing what I wanted to do:
writing and research-more artistic and creative writing. I really
liked it a lot. My experience was really good; I felt that I could
do more things in that department. I met Dr. [Megan] Wong and Dr.
[Alberto] Ledesma, and they helped guide me in many ways.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&apos;t like tests, but I love to write. And the Major Learning
Objectives [MLO] assessment allowed me to write a program and
demonstrate an understanding. That worked out really well for me. I
really enjoyed the flexibility.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong>: Yolanda Gutierrez has spent the last five
years teaching English at Alvarez High School in Salinas. She is
considering attending Chapman University for a master&apos;s degree in
education. She is the first Mexican-American woman ever to
participate in the International Women&apos;s Poetry Conference.</p>
<p>Gutierrez also works as an independent contractor doing video
and film production, writing, voice-overs, and on-camera hosting.
Her clients include El Teatro Campesino, Wooden Ship Productions,
Zanga Entertainment, area television stations, and CSUMB. She
completed a student recruitment video for the university and
produced and hosted the Spanish version of a half-hour monthly
educational show sponsored by the California Teachers Association.
The series, &quot;En Busca de La Excelencia,&quot; is produced in the CSUMB
Teledramatic Arts and Technology complex and airs throughout
California.</p>
