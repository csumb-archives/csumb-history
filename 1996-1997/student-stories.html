  	     <h5>Stephanie Smith</h5>

<p><strong>Then</strong>: Stephanie Smith, originally from Huntington Beach, was a member of CSUMB&#39;s &quot;Pioneer&quot; Class of 1999. She received a  B.A. in Human Communication (HCOM). As an upper-division student, Smith became a student assistant in Student Activities and after graduation became the interim student activities coordinator for a year. Smith&#39;s other accomplishments and activities while at CSUMB included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>International Women&#39;s Day Award Winner for outstanding women and their community contributions</li>

  <li>
    
      Started the first photography club, taking many of the first pictures that made it into the school publications
    
  </li>

  <li>
    
      Helped organize the first Monte Carlo Night, which raised money for the Red Cross and local flood victims (believed to be the first student-run major event)
    
  </li>

  <li>
    
      Part of the first Service Learning courses connected to dance and teaching at many of the local schools
    
  </li>

  <li>
    
      Involved in various leadership conferences and workshops, including Job Fairs, Whole Body/Mind Fairs, and awareness activities (e.g., sexual assault)
    
  </li>

  <li>
    
      Part of the Multicultural Club, including leading many of the Multicultural Comedy Nights, and serving one year as coordinator
    
  </li>

  <li>
    
      Part of the Interclub Council from the beginning, helping to coordinate funding for the student groups on campus
    
  </li>

  <li>
    
      Founding member of the CSUMB Dance Team
    
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Smith says: &quot;We [dance team members] had a great time. We didn&#39;t have uniforms so we bought matching outfits. I remember the first performance was at halftime of a basketball game. We purposely tried to be dancers and not cheerleaders. It was a great experience from the beginning and watching it grow. I was never part of [a dance team] from the get-go.&quot;</p>

<p>About her experiences in the early day of CSUMB: &quot;I thought it would be good to be part of something new and heard that [CSUMB was] going to approach education in a new way. My impression of the school when I first got there sticks out in my mind: the boarded-up windows and abandoned buildings. And in the middle of it all were these brightly colored buildings. I wondered if I&#39;d made the right choice. It seemed like an abandoned ghost town to outsiders.</p>

<p>&quot;Overall, I learned a lot in many different ways. I was prepared for the &#39;real world&#39; more because it wasn&#39;t a typical education. You had to take an active role in your education. Things were always changing, but I was able to take on a leadership role, and I had never really done that before. CSUMB gave me the opportunity to see myself in new ways.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong>: Living in Seattle, Stephanie Smith is now a graduate student at the University of Washington, getting her M.A. in Education with a multicultural education emphasis. She&#39;s also an intern for the Institute for Community Leadership, a nonprofit that focuses on empowering youth to work toward social justice.</p>

<p>Smith says: &quot;Because I took advantage of so many opportunities, I never felt disconnected. I got involved in so many things. The professors were really approachable and cared about looking at things in new ways, and they helped shape what I&#39;m doing now in my career. I didn&#39;t really appreciate it until now, when I see what other people got in their education. I appreciate [my education] more now than I did then.&quot;</p>

<h5>Yolanda Gutierrez</h5>

<p><strong>Then</strong>: A native of Salinas, Yolanda Gutierrez transferred to CSUMB in her junior year. Within two years (in May 1998), she graduated with a degree in Human Communication (HCOM). In her senior year, Gutierrez&#39;s Senior Capstone project was an award winner: &quot;Prisoners without Trial: The Evacuation Experience of the Local Japanese-American Community following the Bombing of Pearl Harbor&quot; includes more than 100 images, archival footage, oral histories, news clippings, government documents, and music, all incorporated into a 35-minute video. The honors for the video included: First Place among entrants from the 21 CSU campuses in the California State University Research Competition&#39;s Humanities and Letters Division; TV interviews; and invitations to speak to local schools, and, perhaps most importantly, to members of the local Japanese-American community. Among Gutierrez&#39; accomplishments and activities while at CSUMB:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    
      Writer for the school newspaper, <em>Otter Realm</em>, which started in 1996
    
  </li>

  <li>
    
      Selected for Leon Panetta&#39;s first Government and Governing class
    
  </li>

  <li>
    
      Very involved with the Japanese-American community-including service commitments that aided in her research for her award-winning Capstone project (see 1997-1998)
    
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Gutierrez says: &quot;Once I got to CSUMB and started talking to people, HCOM sounded like they were doing what I wanted to do: writing and research-more artistic and creative writing. I really liked it a lot. My experience was really good; I felt that I could do more things in that department. I met Dr. [Megan] Wong and Dr. [Alberto] Ledesma, and they helped guide me in many ways.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like tests, but I love to write. And the Major Learning Objectives [MLO] assessment allowed me to write a program and demonstrate an understanding. That worked out really well for me. I really enjoyed the flexibility.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong>: Yolanda Gutierrez has spent the last five years teaching English at Alvarez High School in Salinas. She is considering attending Chapman University for a master&#39;s degree in education. She is the first Mexican-American woman ever to participate in the International Women&#39;s Poetry Conference.</p>

<p>Gutierrez also works as an independent contractor doing video and film production, writing, voice-overs, and on-camera hosting. Her clients include El Teatro Campesino, Wooden Ship Productions, Zanga Entertainment, area television stations, and CSUMB. She completed a student recruitment video for the university and produced and hosted the Spanish version of a half-hour monthly educational show sponsored by the California Teachers Association. The series, &quot;En Busca de La Excelencia,&quot; is produced in the CSUMB Teledramatic Arts and Technology complex and airs throughout California.</p>
