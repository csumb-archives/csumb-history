<p>A transfer student recounts the following: &quot;I remember the
Advance Team [Secret Service] descended on campus [before President
Bill Clinton&apos;s arrival]. It was Labor Day weekend; it was a big
thing, an amazing event. Regardless of your politics, as a college
student it&apos;s a big deal when the president comes to your
campus.&quot;</p>
<p>One Pioneer remembers: &quot;It was very surreal having so many
different people there. The campus was mostly dirt then, and I
remember grown men rolling out huge circular racks of grass in the
middle of the rain. We didn&apos;t really have any buildings, classes or
grass, and there in the mud are these grown men putting in grass
[seemingly] just for the president-that was the surreal part. It
was inspiring because you had the president there, to be able to be
a part of that. Back then there was this sense of being secure and
safe on campus. You could leave your car unlocked and get the sense
of it still being there. Everyone&apos;s looking out for everyone else.
A teacher would sit down and eat with students that weren&apos;t in the
same programs. There weren&apos;t those normal boundaries. You learned
to adapt to change very quickly. You were either open to new
things, or you weren&apos;t. And if you weren&apos;t you didn&apos;t stay. I
stayed.&quot;</p>
<p>NOTE: Students were intrigued by the Secret Service agents, many
of whom were friendly and answered questions. To this day, the FBI
shows up each year on Career Day to recruit. Said one Pioneer
student who works on campus today: &quot;It&apos;s great that they have
always seen us as a resource.&quot;</p>
