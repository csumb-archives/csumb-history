<p>Rina Benmayor arrives as part of the &quot;second wave&quot; faculty in
1995 from Hunter College in New York. (&quot;It was very
appealing-getting in on the ground floor and building something
designed from scratch.&quot;) After originally being hired to be part of
Service Learning, she moves to SBS (Social &amp; Behavioral
Sciences) and eventually joins Josina Makau in Human Communication.
(She&apos;s been there ever since, currently overseeing the Oral History
Archives, in addition to her teaching duties.)</p>
<p>About the university&apos;s earliest days: &quot;We had to learn how to do
budgets, run a department while teaching, design majors and
outcomes. It was a real challenge, but it was creative. We could
sit around and have it be a collective effort. It was great to be
able to design a program that wasn&apos;t inherited, where people could
bring different ideas to the table.&quot; (It&apos;s apparently worked very
well at HCOM: six of the eight President&apos;s Award winners have been
HCOM students.)</p>
<p>&quot;We&apos;ve had incredible students. I remember Jose Aguilera; we
called him &apos;Augie.&apos; He came here, and he was someone with a huge
thirst for knowledge. He was a local boy [from Salinas]. There have
been so many students like him, but to see his evolution . . . He
became very active in student organizations. He lapped up what he
was learning here. When he got the President&apos;s Award, he got up at
the graduation [ceremony] and he asked his parents to stand up-it
was the first graduation in the stadium-and he gave this incredible
speech honoring his parents. Saying, &apos;you are graduating with me
today. You&apos;re the reason I&apos;m here.&apos; It was such an impassioned
speech. And to see that happen . . . He got a lot of support here
and ran with it.&quot; (Jose Aguilera went on to graduate school at San
Jose State University.)</p>
<p>About one of her first classes: &quot;We were in a vault in Building
86. Richard Bains was teaching a music class right outside our
door. We couldn&apos;t close the door [of the vault] because of the
ventilation, and we couldn&apos;t keep the door open because of the
music. It was a challenge.&quot;</p>
<p>About Troy Challenger, CSUMB alumnus and currently on campus as
a Faculty Technology Consultant: &quot;He was a student here [and] was
in the first graduating class. He produced a Powerpoint
presentation of the oral histories that all the students were doing
for class. That was his Capstone.&quot; Dr. Benmayor gives Troy special
mention for assisting in building the Oral History Archive,
teaching faculty how to use software, helping with multiple
audio-visual projects, helping with much of the infrastructure of
the Library Learning Complex, the technology related to Distance
Learning, and for giving numerous workshops across campus.</p>
<p>&quot;[As a campus employee] he makes so much happen for so many
people,&quot; Benmayor says. &quot;We&apos;ve always had a need for him here. We
started to integrate technology into the classroom. That allowed us
to encourage students to go online and start their own web pages.
Troy brought people from the Digital Story community from Berkeley
to teach us about it. That was absolutely <em>wonderful</em>. Troy
is the person who would make it all happen. He&apos;s a saint. He&apos;s
there to help-and he&apos;ll help anybody and everybody. I could never
leave [CSUMB] because I could never find Troy anywhere else.&quot;</p>

class</a>.</p>
<p>About working at CSUMB: &quot;People from other CSUs come here and
say: &apos;You guys work harder than anywhere else.&apos; How does that
happen? We were trying to do something different, and we had a lot
of turnover at the administrative level, a lot of tensions. The
leadership on the day to day . . . people were being shuffled
around; it makes for a lot of work at the lower levels. And some of
the people who came here were a little nutty and wanted to do
something different. So that meant that we had a different kind of
expectation of ourselves.&quot;</p>
